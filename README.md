  Fun with Custom Maps & Animation (with Eli Fitch)
</h1>
<h3 align="center">
  This app was built live on <em>Learn With Jason</em> and it was super fun and I’m sad you weren’t there.
</h3>
<p align="center">
  But don’t worry! You can still: <a href="https://www.learnwithjason.dev/fun-with-custom-maps-and-animation"><strong>watch us build this</strong></a> · <a href="https://fun-with-mapbox.netlify.com"><strong>see the demo</strong></a> · <a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/jlengstorf/fun-with-mapbox&utm_source=learnwithjason&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=devex"><strong>deploy your own copy of this project</strong></a>
</p>

Creating maps might seem intimidating, but [Eli Fitch](https://twitter.com/elifitch) joins us in this episode to teach us how Mapbox can make creating custom, interactive maps a little more approachable and a whole lot more fun!

For links, additional resources, and to watch this app get built live, [see the episode details][episode].
